                                    Svelte is an alternative to web frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. Like its counterparts, Svelte can be used to build entire web apps. It can also be used to create custom elements that can be used in existing web apps implemented with other frameworks.

Svelte was developed by Rich Harris, who formerly worked at The Guardian and is currently at The New York Times. Harris previously created the Ractive web framework, which is used at The Guardian and inspired parts of Vue. Harris also created the Rollup module bundler, which is an alternative to Webpack and Parcel.

Svelte has not yet received the attention it deserves. When it is mentioned, the focus is typically on its ability to produce bundled code that is significantly smaller than the alternatives. However, Svelte makes many tasks easier, including defining components, managing component state, managing application state, and adding animation.

This article provides a thorough introduction to Svelte and walks you through the fundamentals necessary to start building web applications with it.

                                    Modern frontend web development is a polarizing experience: many love it, others despise it.

                                    I am a huge fan of modern web development, though I would describe it as “magical” — and magic has its upsides and downsides:

                                    When you understand how to use the magical tools of web development (babel! bundlers! watchers! etc!), your development workflow is speedy, powerful, and delightful
                                    If you don’t understand the magical tools of web development, it’s terribly confusing
                                    … and trying to learn how the magic works is all-too-often miserable, unless you have someone to help guide you through the tangle of jargon, hot takes, and outdated information on the web
                                    Recently I’ve been needing to explain “modern web development workflows” to folks who only have a cursory of vanilla web development workflows and……                                </p>
